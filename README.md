# RubiksCubeSolver

**Aim**: To create a robotic machine using arduino NANO microcontroller and it's AI based application to solve a rubik's cube.

***

**Objective:** To learn and apply the concepts of Deep Q Learning with Tensorflow in C/C++/C++.NET. Also understand and apply the concepts of robotics and apply them to solve a real world problem using a microcontroller (Arduino Nano).
